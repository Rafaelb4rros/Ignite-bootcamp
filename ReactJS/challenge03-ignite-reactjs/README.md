## :construction_worker: Fake api resources

For this challenge, in addition to the concepts seen in class, we will use some new things to make our application even better. So, before going directly to the challenge code, weâ€™ll explain a little bit of:

- Fake API with JSON Server;

### Fake API with JSON Server

Just as we use MirageJS in module 2 to simulate an API with transaction data from the dt.money application, we will use JSON Server to simulate an API that has the information of genres and films.

Navigate to the created folder, open it in Visual Studio Code and execute the following commands in the terminal:

```bash
yarn
yarn server
```

Then you will see the message:

<img alt="server" src="https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F1abc3356-2936-4106-a4fe-a3fc8efd1373%2FUntitled.png?table=block&id=7fe88f6f-62c6-45c7-a898-d1672dbbe6bd&width=1420&userId=&cache=v2" width=300/>

Notice that he started a fake API with the resources `/stock` and `/products` on `localhost` on port `3333` from the information in the server.json file located at the root of your project. Accessing these routes in your browser, you can see the return of the information already in JSON:

<img src="https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F0fe33995-e128-480c-aaf9-c8d77e0f5544%2FUntitled.png?table=block&id=c98c49ef-d0be-4306-a2e5-028e363c58c6&width=380&userId=&cache=v2" height=300/>
<img src="https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fc89f74cb-4e41-4658-91d4-f8358a973088%2FUntitled.png?table=block&id=fa8ff43b-a903-4ad6-972f-d165a0e5ad94&width=1820&userId=&cache=v2" width=300/>

That way, you just need to consume these API routes normally with Axios.
