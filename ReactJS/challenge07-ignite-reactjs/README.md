## :rocket: About the challenge

In this challenge, you should create an application to train what you've learned so far in ReactJS

This will be an application where your main objective is to add some code snippets so that the image upload application works correctly. You will receive an application with many features and styles already implemented. It must perform requests for its own Next.js API which will return data from FaunaDB (database) and ImgBB (image hosting service). The implemented interface must follow the Figma layout. You will have access to 4 files to implement:

- Infinite Queries and Mutations with React Query;
- Submission of form with React Hook Form;
- Modal and Toast display with Chakra UI;
- Between others.

## :construction_worker: Technologies

- React Query
